I'm a Developer interested in Frontends, Backends, .NET Applications, Game Modding and .NET Reverse Engineering. In 2021 I made my first Lua script, and then a Roblox LUA-C Executor. I gradually moved on to languages such as CSharp, JavaScript,
TypeScript and Python. I mainly use technologies such as MongoDB for my Database choice and Express for Backend Development.
